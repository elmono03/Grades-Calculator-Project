# Grades-Caculator-Project

## Project Descriptions
* The user will be able to enter their qualfication and the grades for each of the units/modules completed and the programme will provide them with the overall grade as well as the amount of UCAS points they will have. Also it will give them a list of university courses that they can do with the points they have in a topic/area of their choice. 


## Goals for Version 1.0?
* Simplest version is working with just one qualification and one level and getting the student to enter only a few of the units/modules. I will be working on V1.0 as I had another project in mind but i tried to get it working and I got frustrated as the websites I was trying to scrape are password protected and it did not allow me to accessed them as they are college internal websites and I also did not want to step into any legal issues at work. 
* I want my final version to also have a GUI either as an app or a Website, so its more visual, and this final version should also offer students recommendation on courses they can study with the current UCAS points they have. 



## Libraries / Other Technologies are Needed.
* I will need a GUI linbrary like Kivy, a library to read spreadsheets either Pandas or CSV, requests and beautiful soup to scrape websites for up to date UCAS points. I may need Flask and/or django if I choose to do the GUI as a website.  
* At the moment the only think that is not python will be a database of grades, qualifications and UCAS points on Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. 




## Risks
* Learning Kivy and other libraries but i will mitigate by reading the guides, I have printed Kivy guide, also I have been watching videos on Kivy and the other libraries to get a feel for them and see what they can offer for my project.

* My full time job could ge in the way, however I have been spending most of my weekends and evening coding and learning further. I have a few weeks over chirstmass off work and I will use this to complete a good majority of my project. 

* A few libraries to learn, however I am prepared to put extra works on the weekends and evenings to learn them and understand them.
