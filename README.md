# Grades-Caculator-Project

# Exactly what your project will do -- try to describe it from the user's perspective.
* the user will be able to enter their qualfication and the grades for each of the units/modules completed and the programme will prvode them with the overall grade as well as the amount of UCAS points they will have. 


# What is "in scope" for Version 1.0 -- what's the simplest possible version of your project?
* Simplest version is working with just one qualification and one level and getting the student to enter only a few of the units/modules. This will be V1.0 as I had another project in mind but i tried to get it working and I got frustrated as the website I was trying to scrape was password protected and it did not allow me to accessed it as it is a college internal website and I also did not want to step into any legal issues. 



# Which Python libraries will you use? Do they have good documentation / tutorials?
* I will need a GUI linbrary like Kivy, a library to read spreadsheets either Pandas or CSV. Also requests and beautiful soup to scrape websites for up to date UCAS points. 



# Do you need anything that isn't Python coding to make your project work?
* At the moment the only think that is not python will be a database of grades, qualifications and UCAS points on Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. 




# What are the risks -- things that would stop your project from getting completed? For each risk, think about how you could mitigate it.
* Learning Kivy and other libraries but i will mitigate by reading the guides, I have printed Kivy guide is over 700 pages, also I have been watching videos on Kivy and the other libraries to get a feel for them and see what they can offer

* My full time job could ge in the way, however I have been spending most of my weekends and evening coding and learning further. I have a few weeks over chirstmass off work and I will use this to complete a good majority of my project.
